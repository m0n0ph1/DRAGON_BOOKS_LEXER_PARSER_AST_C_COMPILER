# Compiler Design - C Compiler
  
## Introduction
A compiler is a software program that compiles program source code files into an executable program. In simple terms, a compiler is a computer program that changes the language in which programs are written into instructions that a computer can use. It is included as part of the integrated development environment IDE with most programming software packages.

## Phases of a compiler
The compilation process is a sequence of various phases. Each phase takes input from its previous stage, has its own representation of the source program, and feeds its output to the next phase of the compiler. The phases are:

1.  Lexical Analysis
2.  Syntax Analysis
3.  Semantic Analysis
4.  Intermediate Code Generation
5.  Code Optimization
6.  Code Generation

## Phases are implemented inside corresponding directories
